# üåê Day 5 - Network Traffic Analysis Report

## üß∞ Tool Used
- Wireshark v4.6.4

## üïµÔ∏è Summary
Captured live traffic on the local machine using Wireshark over the Wi-Fi interface. Common internet usage like browsing and pinging was used to generate network activity. Several standard protocols were identified.

## üìÅ Capture Details
- Filename: `day5_network_capture.pcap`
- Interface: Wi-Fi
- Duration: 1 minute
- Activities performed:
  - Pinged `google.com`
  - Opened websites
  - Background applications (system/browser traffic)

## üìä Protocols Identified

| Protocol | Description | Packet Count |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| TCP      | Transmission Control Protocol for reliable data | ~600+ |
| ICMPv6   | Used for IPv6 ping responses | ~30+ |
| ARP      | Resolves IP to MAC on LAN | ~10+ |

> Replace counts with actual numbers from Wireshark if needed.

## üîç Observations

- **TCP**: Most traffic was TCP-based, likely from browser and background app communication.
- **ICMPv6**: Ping requests and replies from `google.com`.
- **ARP**: ARP packets were used by the system to resolve local IPs to MAC addresses.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This exercise demonstrated how to use Wireshark for basic packet capture and protocol inspection. It provided hands-on experience identifying different layers of network communication in real-time.
